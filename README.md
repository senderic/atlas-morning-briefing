A fully automated morning briefing pipeline that scans ArXiv papers, RSS blogs, stock tickers, and news headlines — then uses Amazon Bedrock to synthesize everything into a Kindle-optimized PDF delivered to your inbox before you wake up.

Supports **Claude Sonnet 4, Kimi K2.5, GLM 4.7, DeepSeek V3.2, Nova Pro, and Nova Lite** on Amazon Bedrock. Switch models in one line of config. Runs without AWS credentials in deterministic mode at zero cost.

## What It Does

```
6:50 AM  ┌─ DeepXiv SDK ────── 90+ papers via semantic hybrid search
         ├─ RSS Feeds ──────── 22 blogs (Anthropic, Karpathy, BAIR, DeepMind...)
         ├─ Finnhub API ────── Stock watchlist with OHLC data
         └─ Brave Search ───── 45+ news headlines from 10 queries
              │
              ▼
         ┌─ Parallel fetch (3 threads) + deduplication
         ├─ TF-IDF + LLM semantic scoring for paper relevance
         ├─ Reproduction feasibility gate (5-dimension, scored /25)
         ├─ Stock-news correlation (links price moves to headlines)
         ├─ Cross-source theme detection (papers × blogs × news)
         ├─ Editorial synthesis with today's key takeaway
         └─ Weekly deep dive (generated every Saturday)
              │
              ▼
         Kindle PDF (6×8") → Gmail SMTP → Kindle + email list
```

### Pipeline Steps

1. **Fetch** — Papers via DeepXiv semantic search (with ArXiv API fallback), RSS blogs, and stock quotes are fetched in parallel (3 threads). Top 10 papers auto-enriched with TLDR summaries, keywords, and GitHub URLs. News queries run after optional dynamic query generation from the intelligence layer.
2. **Deduplicate** — Same-day news/blog overlap removed by URL domain and title. Similar papers collapsed at >85% title similarity (SequenceMatcher). Cross-day dedup skips items from yesterday's briefing via `.atlas-state.json`.
3. **Filter & Score** — Papers scored by a weighted formula: `has_code×7 + topic_match×3 + recency×2 + citation×1`, with infrastructure penalties for datacenter-scale or theory-only work. LLM semantic scoring optionally supplements TF-IDF.
4. **Enrich** — Three parallel LLM calls: paper summarization + semantic scoring, news ranking, blog ranking. Then two more: stock-news correlation, emerging theme detection.
5. **Assess** — Top papers evaluated for reproduction feasibility across 5 dimensions (code availability, data access, infrastructure needs, Bedrock compatibility, engineering effort), each scored 0-5. Papers below the configurable gate (default 12/25) are dropped.
6. **Synthesize** — Cross-section editorial intro, market trend summary, and entity mention tracking for competitive intelligence.
7. **Generate** — Markdown briefing rendered to a Kindle-optimized PDF (6×8 inches) with star ratings, reproduction badges, and stock color coding.
8. **Deliver** — PDF sent to Kindle via Gmail SMTP. Rich HTML version (GitHub-styled, nh3-sanitized) sent to email distribution list.

## Amazon Bedrock Integration

The intelligence layer uses a **tiered model strategy** — heavier models for reasoning-intensive tasks, lighter models for simple brainstorming:

| Tier | Used For | Example Models |
|---|---|---|
| **Heavy** | Editorial synthesis, stock-news correlation, weekly deep dive | Claude Sonnet 4, Kimi K2.5 |
| **Medium** | Paper summaries, semantic scoring, news ranking, reproduction assessment | Claude Sonnet 4, GLM 4.7 |
| **Light** | Topic expansion, blog ranking, emerging themes, trending tracking | Nova Lite, DeepSeek V3.2 |

### Intelligence Features

| Feature | Tier | What It Does |
|---|---|---|
| Topic Expansion | Light | Suggests related ArXiv search queries beyond your config |
| Paper Summarization | Medium | 1-2 sentence takeaway per paper (batched, 10 at a time) |
| Semantic Scoring | Medium | LLM rates paper relevance 0-10 with reasoning |
| Reproduction Assessment | Medium | 5-dimension feasibility score (/25) with verdict |
| Relevance Filtering | Medium | Two-stage gate: LLM pre-filter + deterministic threshold |
| News Ranking | Medium | Top 5 ranked by importance with 2-3 sentence summaries |
| Blog Ranking | Light | Top 5 with 1-5 star ratings and summaries |
| Stock-News Correlation | Heavy | Links price movements to likely news drivers |
| Emerging Themes | Light | Detects new themes not in your configured topics |
| Cross-Section Synthesis | Heavy | Finds connections across papers, news, and blogs |
| Editorial Intro | Heavy | Opens briefing with today's key takeaway |
| Trending Topics | Light | Tracks topics appearing across multiple days |
| Weekly Deep Dive | Heavy | Saturday-only "This Week in AI" narrative (500-800 words) |

### Switch Models

Change one line in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
bedrock:
  models:
    heavy: "us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0"  # or any model below
```

| Model | Bedrock Model ID |
|---|---|
| Claude Sonnet 4 | `us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0` |
| Kimi K2.5 | `moonshotai.kimi-k2.5` |
| GLM 4.7 | `zai.glm-4.7` |
| DeepSeek V3.2 | `deepseek.v3.2` |
| Nova Pro | `amazon.nova-pro-v1:0` |
| Nova Lite | `amazon.nova-lite-v1:0` |

### Disable Bedrock

Run without any LLM features (zero cost, fully deterministic):

```yaml
bedrock:
  enabled: false
```

The pipeline still fetches data, scores papers via TF-IDF, generates the PDF, and delivers it — just without LLM summaries, synthesis, or semantic scoring.

## Paper Scoring

Papers are scored using a weighted formula with four components:

| Component | Default Weight | How It Works |
|---|---|---|
| `has_code` | 7 | +1.0 if GitHub/GitLab/HuggingFace link found in abstract |
| `topic_match` | 3 | TF-IDF cosine similarity to configured topics (0.0-1.0) |
| `recency` | 2 | Exponential decay: e^(-days/30) |
| `citation_count` | 1 | Normalized citation count (when available) |

**Infrastructure penalties** (applied automatically):
- -2.0 for datacenter-scale papers (64+ GPUs, TPU pods, petabyte datasets)
- -1.5 for theory-only papers (no experiments)
- -1.0 for papers with no code repository

**Reproduction feasibility** (LLM-assessed, 5 dimensions x 5 points = /25):
- Code availability, data access, infrastructure requirements, Bedrock compatibility, engineering effort
- Papers below the gate threshold (default: 12/25) are dropped from top picks

## Briefing Output

Each briefing contains these sections:

1. **Executive Summary** — LLM-generated editorial connecting today's top signals across sources
2. **Financial Market Overview** — Stock table with price, change, and AI-identified news drivers
3. **AI & Tech News** — Top 5 articles ranked by relevance with summaries
4. **Blog Updates** — Top 5 blog posts with star ratings (filtered by score >= 3)
5. **Top Papers** — Top 3 papers with reproduction assessment badges (scored /25)
6. **Recent Papers** — Compact list of additional papers with ArXiv links
7. **This Week in AI** — Saturday-only weekly synthesis (accumulated daily)

Output formats: Markdown (`.md`), PDF (`.pdf`), and HTML email.

## Cost

| Service | Cost | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| DeepXiv SDK | Free (1,000 req/day) | Semantic paper search + TLDR enrichment |
| ArXiv API | Free (fallback) | Paper metadata and abstracts |
| Finnhub | Free tier (60 calls/min) | Stock quotes and company profiles |
| Brave Search | Free tier ($5/mo credit) | News headlines |
| Gmail SMTP | Free | Kindle and email delivery |
| Amazon Bedrock | ~$0.40-0.80/run (optional) | Intelligence features |

**Monthly cost (daily runs):** $0 without Bedrock, ~$12-24 with Claude Sonnet 4, ~$2.45 with Nova Lite/Pro.

## Security

> **This project has NOT been reviewed by AWS Security and is NOT suitable for production use.** The practices below are best-effort defensive measures for a testing/prototyping context and do not constitute a security guarantee.

- All API keys and credentials loaded from environment variables — nothing hardcoded
- XML parsing uses `defusedxml` to prevent XXE attacks
- HTML email content sanitized with `nh3` to prevent XSS
- Email addresses masked in all log output
- Config validation at startup catches misconfigurations before API calls
- YAML loaded with `safe_load` everywhere
- No `eval()`, `exec()`, or `subprocess(shell=True)`
- Bedrock call budget enforcement prevents runaway LLM costs

## Running Tests

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest tests/ -v
```

105 tests covering scanners, scoring, deduplication, PDF generation, intelligence layer, and config validation.

## Example Output

See `examples/sample-briefing.md` for a full sample briefing.
