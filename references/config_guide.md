# Configuration Guide

Complete reference for `config.yaml` settings.

## ArXiv Topics

List of topics to search on arxiv.org. Use natural language queries that match paper titles, abstracts, and categories.

```yaml
arxiv_topics:
  - "Agent Evaluation"
  - "Multi-Agent Systems"
  - "Tool Use LLM"
  - "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback"
  - "Chain of Thought"
  - "Prompt Engineering"
```

**Tips**:
- Use specific terms for better matches
- ArXiv searches across title, abstract, and metadata
- Papers are filtered by publication date (see `arxiv_days_back`)

## Blog Feeds

RSS/Atom feeds to monitor for new articles.

```yaml
blog_feeds:
  - name: "Anthropic"
    url: "https://www.anthropic.com/rss.xml"
  - name: "OpenAI"
    url: "https://openai.com/blog/rss.xml"
  - name: "DeepMind"
    url: "https://deepmind.google/blog/rss.xml"
```

**Fields**:
- `name`: Display name for the blog
- `url`: RSS/Atom feed URL

**Tips**:
- Validate feed URLs before adding
- Most blogs have `/feed`, `/rss`, or `/atom.xml` endpoints
- Check blog footer or source HTML for feed links

## Stock Watchlist

Stock symbols to track (uses Finnhub API).

```yaml
stocks:
  - AMZN
  - GOOGL
  - TSLA
  - NVDA
  - MSFT
  - META
```

**Format**: Use standard ticker symbols (e.g., NASDAQ, NYSE)

**API Key**: Requires `FINNHUB_API_KEY` environment variable
- Get free key at: https://finnhub.io/register
- Free tier: 60 calls/minute

## News Queries

Search queries for news aggregation (uses Brave Search API).

```yaml
news_queries:
  - "AI artificial intelligence"
  - "AWS Amazon cloud"
  - "machine learning breakthrough"
  - "LLM large language model"
  - "GPT transformer"
```

**API Key**: Requires `BRAVE_API_KEY` environment variable
- Get key at: https://api.search.brave.com/
- Check your plan limits

**Tips**:
- Use specific queries for targeted results
- Combine related terms in one query
- Results are filtered to past 24 hours by default (`news_freshness`)

**Query shape** (measured against the live Brave news API):
Brave treats a place name as a ranking hint, not a filter. Long keyword
strings drift out of the area -- `"San Diego road closure construction traffic
detour this week"` returned 15 results, none of them from San Diego. Quoting
returns 0 results and `site:` is unsupported on the news endpoint. Use 2-4
words built on one distinctive proper noun instead (`Crown Point San Diego`).

### Freshness Windows

Each interest-graph branch declares the window its topic needs, inherited by
child nodes. Hyperlocal branches need a wider window than market branches --
a neighborhood does not generate news every 24 hours, and a starved `pd` query
gets backfilled with national noise.

```yaml
news_freshness: "pd"          # default for queries with no branch binding

interest_graph:
  roots:
    - id: "neighborhood"
      query: "Pacific Beach San Diego"
      freshness: "pw"          # inherited by every child below
      children:
        - id: "crown_point"
          query: "Crown Point San Diego"
          priority: 1.35       # multiplies the per-run signal score
```

### Geographic Relevance Gate

Drops results that never mention a configured place term, before they reach
the LLM ranking layer. Items from `trusted_sources` pass without a match, since
a local outlet is local even when its headline does not say so. Omit the block
(or set `enabled: false`) to keep every result.

```yaml
geo_filter:
  enabled: true
  place_terms: ["san diego", "pacific beach", "california"]
  trusted_sources: ["voiceofsandiego.org", "kpbs.org"]
  blocked_sources: ["openpr.com", "prnewswire.com"]
```

`blocked_sources` drops a source outright, even when the item mentions a place
term -- blocked beats both `place_terms` and `trusted_sources`. It exists for
pay-to-publish press-release portals: a local briefing once ran "Seaside Pizza
Co. Adds Beer and Wine to Its Pacific Beach Pizza Takeout Experience" from
`openpr.com`, which passed the gate because it does say "Pacific Beach".

### Happenings Refresh Days

`happenings_fetch_weekday` takes a weekday or a list of them (0=Mon ... 6=Sun).
On other days the previous fetch is replayed from state, so an events section
costs a handful of API calls per week instead of per morning.

```yaml
happenings_fetch_weekday: [0, 3]    # Monday and Thursday
```

Pick days that sit *ahead* of what the section advertises. A Saturday-only
fetch left the section promoting a weekend that had already ended by Tuesday;
Thursday previews the coming weekend and Monday refreshes for midweek. The
happenings ranking prompt is also date-aware and drops events whose date has
passed, so a stale cache degrades to a shorter section rather than a wrong one.

### Cross-Outlet Duplicate Collapse

One viral story arrives from a dozen syndicating outlets under different
headlines. Compares Jaccard overlap of headline content words; the copy from a
`trusted_sources` outlet wins. Disabled unless configured.

```yaml
news_similarity_dedup:
  enabled: true
  threshold: 0.3     # retellings measured 0.23-0.47, distinct stories 0.00-0.17
```

## Public-Safety Alerts

Active National Weather Service alerts for specific zones. Free, no API key,
and rendered without the LLM, so the section survives an LLM outage. This is
the reliable answer to "is there a heat warning where I live today" -- news
search answers it with whatever storm is trending nationally.

```yaml
alerts:
  enabled: true
  provider: "nws"
  zones: ["CAZ043", "CAZ243"]   # forecast zone + fire weather zone
  max_alerts: 4
  timeout: 20
  user_agent: "atlas-morning-briefing (you@example.com)"
```

Find your zones with `curl 'https://api.weather.gov/points/<lat>,<lon>'` and
read `forecastZone`, `fireWeatherZone`, and `county` from the response. Prefer
the narrowest zone that covers you: a county zone fires for inland alerts that
may not apply at the coast.

Add `"alerts"` to `section_order` to render the section, and a matching
`section_headings.alerts` label.

## Paper Scoring

Weights for scoring papers based on reproduction value.

```yaml
paper_scoring:
  has_code: 5          # Paper links to code repository
  topic_match: 3       # Matches configured topics
  recency: 2           # Recently published
  citation_count: 1    # Number of citations (if available)
```

**Criteria**:

1. **has_code** (boolean → 0 or weight)
   - Detects GitHub, GitLab, Hugging Face links
   - Searches title and abstract
   - Weight applied if code is available

2. **topic_match** (0-1 score)
   - Cosine similarity between paper and topics
   - Uses TF-IDF vectorization
   - Higher score = better match

3. **recency** (0-1 score)
   - Exponential decay: `score = e^(-days/30)`
   - Today = 1.0, 30 days ago ≈ 0.37
   - Favors recent papers

4. **citation_count** (currently unused)
   - Future enhancement
   - Would require citation API

**Reproduction Difficulty**: Automatically estimated as S/M/L/XL based on:
- Dataset size indicators
- Compute requirements
- Complexity keywords

## Delivery Settings

```yaml
kindle_email: "username@kindle.com"
sender_email: "agent@gmail.com"
output_format: "kindle"  # kindle | a4 | letter
```

**Fields**:
- `kindle_email`: Your Kindle email address (find in Amazon account)
- `sender_email`: Gmail address (must match `GMAIL_USER`)
- `output_format`: PDF page size
  - `kindle`: 6x8 inch (Kindle Scribe optimized)
  - `a4`: 8.27x11.69 inch
  - `letter`: 8.5x11 inch

**Environment Variables Required**:
- `GMAIL_USER`: Your Gmail address
- `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`: Gmail app password (not regular password)

See `kindle_setup.md` for detailed Kindle configuration.

## File Naming

Pattern for output filenames.

```yaml
file_naming: "Atlas-Briefing-{type}-{yyyy}.{mm}.{dd}"
```

**Variables**:
- `{type}`: Briefing type (e.g., "Daily", "Weekly")
- `{yyyy}`: Year (4 digits)
- `{mm}`: Month (2 digits, zero-padded)
- `{dd}`: Day (2 digits, zero-padded)

**Examples**:
- `Atlas-Briefing-{type}-{yyyy}.{mm}.{dd}` → `Atlas-Briefing-Daily-2026.03.06`
- `Briefing-{yyyy}-{mm}-{dd}` → `Briefing-2026-03-06`
- `Daily-Digest-{mm}{dd}` → `Daily-Digest-0306`

## Paper Recommendations

```yaml
num_paper_picks: 3
```

Number of top-scored papers to highlight in "Papers for Reproduction" section.

## Date Ranges

```yaml
arxiv_days_back: 7
```

Number of days to look back when searching ArXiv. Papers older than this are filtered out.

**Recommendations**:
- Daily briefings: 1-2 days
- Weekly briefings: 7 days
- Monthly digests: 30 days

## Content Limits

```yaml
max_papers: 20
max_blogs: 10
max_news: 15
```

Maximum items to fetch per section.

**Tips**:
- Higher limits = longer generation time
- ArXiv API has rate limits
- Adjust based on your reading capacity

## PDF Settings

```yaml
pdf:
  font_size: 10
  line_spacing: 1.5
  include_toc: true
  include_emoji: false
```

**Fields**:
- `font_size`: Base font size in points (8-14 recommended)
- `line_spacing`: Line spacing multiplier (1.0-2.0)
- `include_toc`: Table of contents (not yet implemented)
- `include_emoji`: Strip emoji from output (recommended: false)

**Kindle Optimization**:
- Smaller font sizes work better on Kindle
- 1.5 line spacing improves readability
- 6x8 inch page size fits Kindle Scribe perfectly

## Logging

```yaml
log_level: "DEBUG"  # DEBUG | INFO | WARNING | ERROR
```

**Levels**:
- `DEBUG`: Verbose output (API calls, parsing details)
- `INFO`: Standard output (progress, summary)
- `WARNING`: Only warnings and errors
- `ERROR`: Only errors

```

**Fields**:
- `enabled`: Set to `false` to disable all LLM features (zero cost, deterministic)
- `region`: AWS region for Bedrock API calls
- `temperature`: Sampling temperature (0.0-1.0, lower = more deterministic)
- `max_tokens`: Maximum tokens per model response
- `models`: Model IDs for each tier

**Tiers**:
- `heavy`: Used for cross-section synthesis, editorial content, stock-news correlation. Needs strong reasoning.
- `medium`: Used for paper summaries, semantic scoring, reproduction assessment. Needs accuracy.
- `light`: Used for topic expansion. Simple brainstorming task.

**Cost per run** (default: Claude Opus 4.6 on all tiers):
- **Estimated: ~$0.40-0.80/run, ~$12-24/month**

For lower cost, switch to tiered models:
- Heavy (Claude Sonnet 4): ~$0.06
- Medium (Nova Pro): ~$0.03
- Light (Nova Lite): ~$0.001
- **Tiered total: ~$0.08/run, ~$2.45/month**

**Supported models** (any Bedrock model can be used):

| Model | ID | Recommended Tier |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Sonnet 4 | `us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0` | heavy |
| Nova Pro | `amazon.nova-pro-v1:0` | medium |
